# CouplePlay App
Let's create a Next.js app using Vercel and SupaBase that is basically an app for couples to play games together, online. There will be a bunch of different games.

## UI/UX Design
The app design and UI and UX be very clean and flat and should communicate well to couples. It doesn't need to be pink or anything like that, but should be cute and nice and cozy for the couples to get the playful vibe and be interested in playing the game. It should also work very well on mobile. As a matter of fact, it should be mobile-first design. Should work on desktop too, but the mobile is one of the higher priorities.

## General System (for all games)
Let's say the boyfriend will enter with the website, The first thing he will be prompted to is to insert his name, so he puts his name, and then there will be a list of games that he can pick from. Once he selects the game, the website will create a room for him to basically copy the link and share with his girlfriend. So his girlfriend will be able to join the room, and once she joins, the website will ask for her name, and then she and him will be at the same room and the game will start. So this is the principle that every game will follow. So basically there will be this room system, so the first person will enter the website, type his name, select the game, then a room will be created he can share with someone else. The other person will join the room, type the other person's name, and then they will be able to play together this game. All the games are for two players, and the room will be automatically deleted and invalidated after an hour of inactivity. So if they stop playing, the room will be deleted.

So this is the initial flow, and after that every single game will behave differently, so I will describe them below.

## Game 1: Random Questions
The first game will be a random questions game. The first step of this game, or stage one, will start as soon as the two partners join the room, and each partner will be able to type as many questions and register those questions as he wants. So he can type, do you like cats? Do you prefer beach or the mountains? What's your favorite colors? Etc. And every time one person types the questions and submits this question, it goes to one list and gets displayed to both sides, so they both can see live the questions that are being added. When the first person creates the room, after selecting this game, there should be a setting to hide each other's messages and if it's set to hide, they will not see each other questions as they type. And then once one side is satisfied with the questions, he clicks complete. And then this gets displayed that one person, that the other person completed the quests, like the typings, and then once the both persons completes, or in other words, once they mark as complete, the game goes to the step two. So again, in this first phase of the game, the partners will build together a list of questions, random questions to be asked. And then in the second step, the second phase of the game, one step at a time, and each time one person, so one time the boyfriend, the other time the girlfriend, and then the boyfriend again, and then the girlfriend, and this goes on and on until there's no questions left. A random question will be asked to the current person playing, and this person will have to reply to this question, to answer this question. And then as this person types, the other person should see live the reply being typed. And then this person can click complete to indicate that he finished typing, and the other person, the one that is not typing, but it is only reading the message, should be able to see that the person completed, and then also mark as complete to indicate that this person read the reply. And once both mark as complete, the game continues to the next person in the next question until there's no more questions left. Once there's no more questions left, it should go to one last stage that will basically display all the questions and who answered the questions and the answer, so all the two partners will be able to see and enjoy and have fun reading again the messages.

## Game 2: Idea Matching Game
The second game will be very similar to the first one when it comes to the behavior, but this one is an idea matching game. Basically, it will help the couple to identify ideas that they do have in common, in other words, stuff to do or stuff they like, that they are into it and they do have in common, without necessarily exposing them to stuff that they don't agree. This can be used for many different things, for example, can be used for sexual activities, ideas that maybe it will be too uncomfortable to talk about, such as fetish and kinks, but also can be used to something else, such as movies they like, musics, places to go, etc. And as a matter of fact, when the first user is creating the room and after selecting this game in particular, he can choose if he wants the couple to manually type the ideas or play a specific game. And when playing a specific game, a specific category actually, he will be able to select the category, such as sexual fetishes, sex ideas or music, genres and places, etc. And by selecting this, they will be able to skip the first step of the second game and go straight to the second step with a preset of existing anonymous list of ideas. So let's consider that they choose to type by hand, so then the game goes to the first step, which is just like the game number one, each person of the couple will be able to type as many ideas as they want. And these will be displayed live to each other or if they... Actually, these are not going to be displayed live to each other because it breaks the whole point of the game. But as they type and submit the idea, it will be displayed to each other only. So if the boyfriend types and submits, only the boyfriend will see the submissions he did and the same for the girlfriend. But then, once they both mark as complete, the game goes to the step number two and the step number two will be the same if they typed all the ideas by hand individually or if they choose a template to play this specific game. Basically, all the ideas will be mixed together and they will be anonymously displayed to each other, meaning that each other is not going to be seeing the other person's response live. So the boyfriend will see one screen and the girlfriend will see another screen and for each person, for the boyfriend and the girlfriend, all the lists of ideas will be walked through and the person will be asked if they are into that idea or not. So there are only two buttons, he can either reply yes or no. And basically, once they both finish replying yes or no for all the lists, of course, if one finishes first, it will wait for the second one to finish and a message will be displayed that they are waiting. But once they are both finished, the game will go to one last step that will basically display only the ideas that they are both into it. So it will display on both screens all the ideas that they have in common.
